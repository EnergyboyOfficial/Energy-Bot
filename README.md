# Gla-DOS V11

# !hello

# !spinthebottle:
This command allows a player to join the "Spin the Bottle" game. When a player sends this command, their name is added to the list of participants.

# !endspinthebottle:
This command allows a player to leave the "Spin the Bottle" game. When a player sends this command, their name is removed from the list of participants.

# !spinit:
This command initiates the bottle spinning process. It can only be used when there are at least two players in the "Spin the Bottle" game.
When the command is executed, the bot randomly selects two players from the list of participants.
The two selected players will be mentioned in the chat, indicating that it's their turn to interact. This mimics the traditional "Spin the Bottle" experience where the bottle points to two people, suggesting that they should perform a dare or truth together.
And many more!


# HOW TO USE:
First, make a discord bot on Discord's developer portal.
Second, take the token and put it in the place that says BOT-TOKEN or something.
Third, go into your user settings, go to advanced and activate discord developer mode.
Fourth, go to your user profile and there will be an option to copy user ID.
Fifth, replace the part in the code that says YOUR-ID with your discord ID.
And last but not least run the code and everything will work fine!
